<h1>Eager to Learn</h1>
<p>Shantilal's favourite subjects were Gujarati, geography, history and mathematics. In mathematics and history, he achieved top marks. Initially, he had no real interest in learning English. However, when Shankarlal and his other friends proposed to him to learn English, he readily showed a willingness to study the subject.
